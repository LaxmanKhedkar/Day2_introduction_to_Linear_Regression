# 📊 Linear Regression Project

Welcome to my **Linear Regression Project**! 🚀  
This repository demonstrates the complete process of building a **Linear Regression model** from scratch — starting with understanding the theoretical concepts, performing data preprocessing, visualizing data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.  

--- 

## 📖 Overview

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning.  
It models the relationship between **independent variables (X)** and a **dependent variable (Y)** using a straight line (best fit line).  

🔑 **Goal of this Project:**  
To predict the dependent variable (output) based on one or more independent variables (input) and evaluate the performance using statistical metrics.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

| Concept                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **X-Axis**                | Represents the **Independent Variable (Input Feature)** |
| **Y-Axis**                | Represents the **Dependent Variable (Output Target)** |
| **Independent Variable (X)** | The input feature used for prediction |
| **Dependent Variable (Y)**   | The target output we are trying to predict |
| **Model (Hypothesis)**    | A mathematical function that represents the relationship between X and Y |
| **Prediction**            | Model’s output when given a new value of X |

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The model performance was measured using:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

These metrics help understand how close predictions are to actual values.
